      <h3>Professional profile</h3>

      <p>
        I have worked in the software industry since 2018 and specialized in
        front-end development. Most of my work experience involved web
        development in <strong>Typescript</strong> and <strong>React.</strong>
        I'm interested in functional programming and building software with care
        for accessibility and user experience. I'm a trans woman, which is why
        I'm looking for a place that's inclusive and positive towards queer
        people.
      </p>

        <h4>How I work</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              I like building software that's reliable and writing code that's easy to read, understand and maintain.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              I'm motivated by teamwork, challenging goals, making high-quality
              products that provide value to users, and helping my team grow
              professionally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I like to make the team I work with be able to focus on the
              problems at hamd by building and providing tools that make our
              tasks easier and our work more efficient.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <p>
        Before I started developing software, I used to study psychology. In the
        next section I'll be listint only the jobs that came after I switched
        paths.

      <h3>Work experience</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Front-end developer at <strong>Telecom</strong> (2021 - 2023): I
          started working at Telecom to re-write their TV streaming clients for
          browsers and smart TVs with industry standards and scalable code. The
          mission was to be able to update the apps and provide new features and
          fixes more frequently. I trained newcomers and co-ordinated joint
          operations between teams at times. I also participated actively in the
          personnel selection process.
        </li>

        <li>
          Front-end developer at <strong>LAB-A</strong> (now Nexup, 2019 -
          2021): We (a team of only four developers) developed a digital medical system from scratch.
           I wrote the first lines of code of the
          front-end. Today, this is their flagship product, with hundreds of
          actve users. I was frequently in charge of communicating with the
          design and back-end teams to negotiate feature implementations. I took
          part in decision-making regarding CI/CD, linting and automated
          testing, and our eventual migration to Typescript.
        </li>

        <li>
          Full-stack developer at <strong>ATIX LABS</strong> (now part of
          Globant, 2018 - 2019): My first job in software development. I participated in several projects and I was
          involved in both front-end and back-end development.

      <h3>Technologies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>5+ years React, Typescript, SCSS, Redux, Redux-toolkit, Immer, Gitlab, Gitlab CI/CD</li>
        <li>7+ years Javascript, HTML, CSS, Linux</li>

        <h4>Other knowledges</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ports-and-adapters architecture (hexagonal architecture): I
            implemented a module with this architecture at Telecom in order to
            make it easier to switch web services when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            ESLint. I believe linters are indispensable for teams. I've often been in
            charge of linter configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jest and testing in general. Every time I can I write my tests
            before I implement my code. This helps me think more clearly about
            wht I'm building and I end up making software that's more reliable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Agile methodologies: In every job experience I've had we worked with
            scrum and sprints.
