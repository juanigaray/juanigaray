          <h3>Professional profile</h3>

          <p>
            I have worked in software since 2018 and specialized in front-end
            development. Most of my work experience involves web development in
            <strong>Typescript</strong> and
            <strong>React.</strong>
            I'm interested in functional programming and building software with
            care for accessibility and UX. I'm trans, which is why I'm looking
            for a place that's inclusive and positive towards LGBT+ people.

          <h4>How I work</h4>
          <p>
            I aim to build reliable software and to write code that's easy to
            read, understand and maintain. I'm motivated by teamwork,
            challenging goals, making high-quality products that provide value
            to users, and helping my team grow professionally. I like to help my
            team focus on the problems at hand by providing tools to make our
            tasks easier and our work more efficient.

            <strong>98.css</strong>: I've been a maintainer since I made a few
            contributions in 2020. This project provides a design system so that
            web pages can look like Windows 98. You can see the design system

            <strong>EDiPo</strong>: I joined the team in January of 2024 and
            since then I have established CI/CD pipelines, repository rules and
            integration with several technologies such as Typescript and CSS
            Modules, as well as solving bugs, enhancing performance and
            participating in decision-making regarding present and future
            projects.

      <h3>Work experience</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Front-end developer at <strong>Telecom</strong> (2021 - 2023): I
          started working at Telecom to re-write their TV streaming clients for
          browsers and smart TVs with industry standards and scalable code. The
          mission was to be able to update the apps and provide new features and
          fixes more frequently. I trained newcomers and co-ordinated joint
          operations between teams at times. I also participated actively in the
          personnel selection process.
        </li>

        <li>
          Front-end developer at <strong>LAB-A</strong> (now Nexup, 2019 -
          2021): We (a team of only four devs) developed a digital medical
          system from scratch. I wrote the first lines of code of the front-end.
          Today, this is their flagship product, with hundreds of actve users. I
          was frequently in charge of communicating with the design and back-end
          teams to negotiate feature implementations. I took part in
          decision-making regarding CI/CD, linting and automated testing, and
          our eventual migration to Typescript.
        </li>

        <li>
          Full-stack developer at <strong>ATIX LABS</strong> (now part of
          Globant, 2018 - 2019): My first job in software development. I
          participated in several projects and I was involved in both front-end
          and back-end development.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Cambridge English: Advanced / CAE</strong> (2010)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Psychology at University of Buenos Aires</strong> (unfinished,
          2011 - 2016): I started my studies interested in human behaviour and
          was quickly fascinated with the cognitive and behaviourist schools of
          thought. At one point I had attended every optional course I could and
          was left only with courses with a strong psychoanalytical view. That's
          when I decided to switch to engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Engineering at University of Buenos Aires</strong>
          (unfinished, 2017 - 2020): After a year of natural sciences and maths,
          I started programming and I quickly discovered that I loved it. I
          started coding at home, taking online courses and watching Youtube
          videos about programming. At college I ended up taking the role of
          leader in group assignments. Around this time I got my first job in
          software development.

      <h4>Other skills</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ports-and-adapters architecture (hexagonal architecture): I
          implemented a module with this architecture at Telecom in order to
          make it easier to switch web services when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          ESLint. I believe linters are indispensable for teams. I've often been
          in charge of linter configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jest and testing in general. Every time I can I write my tests before
          I implement my code. This helps me think more clearly about what I'm
          building and I end up making software that's more reliable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agile methodologies: In every job experience I've had we worked with
          scrum and sprints.

          I play many instruments, namely piano, sax, uke-bass but I enjoy
          playing classical guitar the most. I've also been writing songs
          lately.

          We do agile at home with my roommate. We have two-week sprints and a
