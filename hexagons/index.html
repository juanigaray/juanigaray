          During the brief-ish sabbatical that I started in 2023 (and which will
          hopefully end during early 2024), one night I was at a party
          where I knew very few people. Grabbing some ice, I started chatting
          with a guy I'd had a small interaction with before.
        </p>
        <section class="dialogue">
          <p class="dialogue-line">"So, what do you do for a living?"</p>
          <p class="dialogue-line">"I'm a game developer!"</p>
        </section>
        <p>
          About twenty minutes later, me and this guy were holding board markers
          and drawing hexagons on the wall while more and more curious people
          gathered around asking what on Earth we were talking about. We were
          talking about hexagons!
        </p>
        <section>
          The concept was simple:
          <ul>
            <li>There is a map made up of hexagons</li>
            <li>
              Each hexagon has an intrinsic quality (let's call it its
              'element')
            </li>
            <li>
              Each side that's shared by two hexagons has a property (let's call
              it its 'powerup') that's the product of the qualities of the two
              hexagons that are touching
            </li>
          </ul>

          <section class="dialogue">
            <p class="dialogue-line">
              "I'm thinking of building each hexagon as an object with six
              individual sides, and then figure out how to assign hexagons to
              sides. I don't know."
            </p>
            <p class="dialogue-line">
              "Wait, no, I think... have you tried representing it as an array?
              This should follow a few simple rules and save you a lot of
              trouble"
            </p>
          </section>

          In the end, we came up with a simple algorithm that both
          <ul>
            <li>Represents the hexagon map in a simple data structure</li>
            <li>
              Is able to easily determine which other hexagons a hexagon is
              touching
            </li>
          </ul>

          If you want to see the code for this algorithm, press F12, because
          here's a demonstration!
