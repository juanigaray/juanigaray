      <h1>How to use this page-app</h1>
      <p>
        Ever want to share a date with someone else who's in a different
        timezone? Oh, let's meet friday at, uh, 10 PM GMT! That is
        <strong> very annoying</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are tools to solve this out there but they tend to do too many
        things and they're uglier than this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page does one thing. It asks for a date in YOUR timezone and gives
        you a URL that you can send to people. When someone enters that URL,
        this page will detect where their browser is and show them the date
        converted to that timezone.
      </p>

        <h1>Enter the date you want to share</h1>
        <form class="date-form">
          <input type="datetime-local" id="date-input" />
          <button id="select-date-button">GENERATE DATE URL</button>
