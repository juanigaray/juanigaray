      <summary>Lost on what this page does?</summary>
      <p> Ever want to set a time and date for an activity with someone else who's in a different timezone? <em>Oh,
          let's meet friday at, uh, 10 PM GMT!</em>

        It's kind of annoying, especially with names like "EST" which you never know what GMT values they have.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are tools out there to help you solve this but they tend to do too many
        things. This page does one thing. It asks for a date in YOUR timezone and redirects
        you to a URL that you can send to people. When someone enters that URL,
        this page will detect where their browser is and show them the date
        converted to that timezone.
